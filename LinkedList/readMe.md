# Linked Lists

A linked list is a way to store a collection of elements. Like an array these can be character or integers. Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.


Node:

* A node is a collection of two sub-elements or parts. A data part that stores the element and a next part that stores the link to the next node.

* A linked list is formed when many such nodes are linked together to form a chain. Each node points to the next node present in the order. The first node is always used as a reference to traverse the list and is called HEAD. The last node points to NULL.


# Types of Linked List

Following are the various types of linked list.

* Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

* Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

* Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

# Basic Operations

Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

* Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

* Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

* Display − Displays the complete list.

* Search − Searches an element using the given key.

* Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
